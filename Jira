Intended Value & Expected Outcome
	•	Goal:
Migrate ~14,000 SiteScope-based ping/port monitors to Prometheus Blackbox Exporter, and implement alerting rules using Prometheus-compatible alerting engine.
	•	Value:
Eliminate licensing cost and reduce operational overhead by moving to a scalable, open-source-based monitoring solution. Align with firm-wide observability modernization goals.
	•	Outcome:
Full migration of SiteScope monitors with alert rules deployed, tested, and validated via Blackbox Exporter and Prometheus Alertmanager stack. Resulting in ~$1.5M annual cost avoidance.

⸻

Phases
	•	Discovery & Mapping: Identify all existing monitors and targets from SiteScope.
	•	Automation: Use Python/Ansible scripts to convert and deploy into Prometheus config.
	•	Validation: End-to-end monitor validation for ICMP and TCP using Grafana dashboards.
	•	Alerting Implementation: Create and test alert rules for uptime monitoring in Prometheus.
	•	Dashboarding & Handover: Implement Grafana dashboards and hand over to support teams.

All phases can run in parallel with modular checkpoints.

⸻

Testability & Feasibility
	•	Testability:
	•	Simulated outages to test ICMP/TCP monitor responsiveness.
	•	Alert trigger verification on actual port downtimes.
	•	Feasibility:
	•	Tools and automation already available (blackbox exporter, Grafana Agent, custom scripts).
	•	No proprietary dependency after migration.

⸻

Dependencies
	•	SiteScope target inventory export.
	•	Blackbox endpoints to be reachable from Prometheus nodes.

⸻

Risks & Unknowns
	•	Risk:
Some legacy targets may be inaccessible from Prometheus hosts due to firewall or network segmentation.
	•	Unknown:
Variability in SiteScope configuration may require manual intervention for edge cases.

⸻

Technology Partners
	•	Observability Engineering
	•	Site Reliability Team
	•	Infra Ops (for firewall/network rule coordination)

⸻

Performance & Nonfunctional Requirements
	•	Target SLA for all monitors: < 30s probe latency.
	•	Alert delivery SLA: < 60s from detection to notification.
	•	Ensure minimal false positives by tuning alerting thresholds and rules.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria
	•	At least 14,000 ping/port monitors successfully migrated and active in Prometheus.
	•	ICMP and TCP probes reflect actual target status within 1-minute scrape intervals.
	•	Critical alert rules implemented and tested for at least 3 key environments (e.g., Prod, UAT, DR).
	•	Grafana dashboard built with success/failure breakdown and trend over 24h.
	•	Operational runbook updated and support team trained
