Intended Value & Expected Outcome
	•	Goal:
Forecast CPU, memory, and disk usage trends for non-production environments using historical metrics and feed the forecasts into MCAP (Capacity Management Platform).
	•	Value:
Enables data-driven capacity planning and proactive scaling decisions. Reduces risks of outages in performance/stress testing environments and aligns with capacity governance policies.
	•	Outcome:
Forecasted metrics (daily/weekly granularity) will be generated via time series models (e.g., Prophet) and pushed into MCAP via API or file ingestion. Platform teams can view forecast vs. actuals for trend validation and scaling triggers.

⸻

Phases
	•	Phase 1: Data Ingestion
Ingest historical metrics (CPU, memory, disk) for key non-prod systems from Prometheus or Grafana Mimir.
	•	Phase 2: Forecasting Engine
Apply time series forecasting models (e.g., Facebook Prophet or Holt-Winters) to generate forward-looking usage patterns.
	•	Phase 3: Integration with MCAP
Transform forecasted output to MCAP-compatible schema and push via secure API/file drop.
	•	Phase 4: Validation & Tuning
Compare forecasts with actual usage, adjust model parameters, and finalize automated job.

⸻

Testability & Feasibility
	•	Testability:
	•	Validate forecasted output accuracy using known test periods.
	•	Compare prediction vs. actual delta under defined tolerance threshold (e.g., <15%).
	•	Feasibility:
	•	Historical data available from existing monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana).
	•	Forecasting models proven on similar telemetry datasets.
	•	MCAP ingestion pipeline supports structured input.

⸻

Dependencies
	•	Availability of historical metrics (minimum 30 days) in Prometheus/Mimir.
	•	API/File ingestion support and schema from MCAP team.

⸻

Risks & Unknowns
	•	Risk:
Low data quality or gaps may impact forecast accuracy.
	•	Unknowns:
	•	MCAP integration specifics (rate limits, auth method, schema evolution).
	•	Potential seasonality or workload spikes in non-prod data.

⸻

Technology Partners
	•	Observability Engineering Team
	•	Platform Ops / Infra Team
	•	MCAP Product/Integration Team

⸻

Performance & Nonfunctional Requirements
	•	Forecasting job must complete within 10 minutes for each metric per system.
	•	Accuracy target: ≤ 15% deviation for majority of forecast points.
	•	Secure data push to MCAP with logging and error handling.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria
	•	CPU, Memory, and Disk forecasts generated for all non-prod servers over a 7-day horizon.
	•	Forecasts successfully pushed to MCAP for at least 3 cycles (daily/weekly).
	•	Validation reports comparing actual vs. forecasted values available.
	•	MCAP confirms ingestion and visualization of forecast metrics.
	•	Runbook created and automation jobs scheduled with monitoring.
